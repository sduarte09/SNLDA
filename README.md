# SNLDA
SNLDA (SPATIOTEMPORAL NON-LINEAR DYNAMICS ASSESSMENT) framework incorporates three main components: (i) standard performance metrics (correlations, RMSE, and dry spell duration), (ii) rainfall spatiotemporal objects (characterizing precipitation events through attributes such as volumes and start-end centroids), and (iii) non-linear dynamics complexity (reconstructing dynamical behavior from time series and evaluating attractors properties, including the Hurst and Lyapunov exponents). These elements were analyzed both individually and in combination (Multi-metric error plot). Daily ERA5-Land information and in-situ rain gauge data comprising 558 stations from 1980 to 2020 were used, enriched by an Inverse Distance Weighting (IDW) interpolation to facilitate comparison across spatial scales.
Three files are included in this repository, one for each component, standard errors, attractor properties and spatiotemporal objects.
